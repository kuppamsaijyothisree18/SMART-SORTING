# 🍎 Smart Sorting: Transfer Learning for Identifying Rotten Fruits and Vegetables

## 📌 Project Overview
**Smart Sorting** is an innovative computer vision project designed to automate the detection of rotten fruits and vegetables using **transfer learning**. By leveraging pre-trained deep learning models and fine-tuning them on customized datasets, this system accurately distinguishes fresh produce from spoiled items, improving efficiency, reducing waste, and minimizing human error.



## 🎯 Objectives
- Automate sorting of fruits and vegetables
- Improve detection accuracy using transfer learning
- Reduce labor costs and manual inspection errors
- Minimize food waste across supply chains
- Enable real-time monitoring and alerts


## 🧠 Key Concept: Transfer Learning
Transfer learning allows us to use pre-trained neural networks (trained on large datasets) and adapt them to our specific task. Instead of training a model from scratch, we fine-tune an existing model to recognize fresh vs. rotten produce efficiently and quickly.


## 🏭 Use Case Scenarios

### Scenario 1 — Food Processing Plants
Workers manually sort thousands of items daily, which is slow and error-prone.

**Solution:**  
A conveyor-belt camera system captures images of produce. The trained model:
- Detects rotten items instantly
- Triggers automated removal
- Improves speed and accuracy



### Scenario 2 — Supermarket Quality Control
Stores must ensure fresh produce before stocking shelves.

**Solution:**  
At receiving docks, the system scans shipments in real time:
- Detects spoiled produce
- Flags poor-quality batches
- Maintains store reputation



### Scenario 3 — Smart Refrigerators
Households often waste food due to unnoticed spoilage.

**Solution:**  
Built-in fridge cameras monitor stored produce:
- Detect early spoilage signs
- Send mobile notifications
- Suggest consumption priority
